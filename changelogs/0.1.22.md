## Compatibility

VShard 0.1.22 is fully compatible with the previous VShard versions.

## Functionality added or changed

* A new trigger `vshard.storage.on_bucket_event()` to react on bucket events,
  such as move or GC (gh-372).

* `vshard.router/storage.info()` now accept an option `{with_services = true}`
  to get additional info about background services (such as discovery or
  rebalancer) that are working on the current instance (gh-107).

## Bugs fixed

* Fixed a bug that the rebalancing could lead to inconsistency in buckets. In
  scope of the same bugfix all the updates in `_bucket` space are now severely
  restricted and validated (gh-377, gh-173).

* `vshard.router/storage.cfg{}` now can not be called from multiple fibers at
  the same time (gh-140).

* Fixed a bug that certain router error objects didn't have `router_name` field.
